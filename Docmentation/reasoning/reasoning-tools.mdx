title: Reasoning Tools
---

A new class of research is emerging where giving models tools for structured thinking, like a scratchpad, greatly improves their reasoning capabilities.

For example, by giving a model a **"think" tool**, we can greatly improve its reasoning capabilities by providing a dedicated space for working through the problem. This is a simple, yet effective approach to add reasoning to non-reasoning models.

First published by Anthropic in [this blog post](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-think-tool), this technique has been practiced by many AI Engineers (including our own team) long before it was published.

## v0: The Think Tool

The first version of the Think Tool was published by Anthropic in [this blog post](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-think-tool).

```python claude_thinking_tools.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude
from agno.tools.thinking import ThinkingTools
from agno.tools.yfinance import YFinanceTools

reasoning_agent = Agent(
    model=Claude(id="claude-3-7-sonnet-latest"),
    tools=[
        ThinkingTools(add_instructions=True),
        YFinanceTools(
            stock_price=True,
            analyst_recommendations=True,
            company_info=True,
            company_news=True,
        ),
    ],
    instructions="Use tables where possible",
    markdown=True,
)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    reasoning_agent.print_response(
        "Write a report on NVDA. Only the report, no other text.",
        stream=True,
        show_full_reasoning=True,
        stream_intermediate_steps=True,
    )
```

## v1: The Reasoning Tools

While the v0 Think Tool is a great start, it is limited in that it only allows for a thinking space. The v1 Reasoning Tools take this one step further by allowing the Agent to **analyze** the results of their actions (i.e. tool calls), greatly improving the Agents' ability to solve problems that require sequential tool calls.

**ReasoningTools = `think` + `analyze`**

```python claude_reasoning_tools.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude
from agno.tools.reasoning import ReasoningTools
from agno.tools.yfinance import YFinanceTools

reasoning_agent = Agent(
    model=Claude(id="claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219"),
    tools=[
        ReasoningTools(add_instructions=True),
        YFinanceTools(stock_price=True, analyst_recommendations=True, company_info=True, company_news=True),
    ],
    show_tool_calls=True,
)
reasoning_agent.print_response(
    "Write a report comparing NVDA to TSLA", stream=True, markdown=True
)
```

## v2: The Knowledge Tools

The Knowledge Tools take the v1 Reasoning Tools one step further by allowing the Agent to **search** a knowledge base and **analyze** the results of their actions.

**KnowledgeTools = `think` + `search` + `analyze`** 

```python knowledge_tools.py
import os
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.embedder.openai import OpenAIEmbedder
from agno.knowledge.url import UrlKnowledge
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools.knowledge import KnowledgeTools
from agno.vectordb.lancedb import LanceDb, SearchType


agno_docs = UrlKnowledge(
    urls=["https://docs.agno.com/llms-full.txt"],

    vector_db=LanceDb(
        uri="tmp/lancedb",
        table_name="agno_docs",
        search_type=SearchType.hybrid,
        embedder=OpenAIEmbedder(id="text-embedding-3-small"),
    ),
)


knowledge_tools = KnowledgeTools(
    knowledge=agno_docs,
    think=True,   
    search=True,  
    analyze=True,  
    add_few_shot=True, 
)


agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    tools=[knowledge_tools],
    show_tool_calls=True, 
    markdown=True, 
)


agno_docs.load(recreate=True)


agent.print_response("How do I build multi-agent teams with Agno?", stream=True)
```
