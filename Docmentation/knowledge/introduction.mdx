title: What is Knowledge?
sidebarTitle: Overview
description: Knowledge is domain-specific information that the Agent can search at runtime to make better decisions (dynamic few-shot learning) and provide accurate responses (agentic RAG).
---
Knowledge is stored in a vector db and this searching on demand pattern is called Agentic RAG.

<Accordion title="Dynamic Few-Shot Learning: Text2Sql Agent" icon="database">
Example: If we're building a Text2Sql Agent, we'll need to give the table schemas, column names, data types, example queries, common "gotchas" to help it generate the best-possible SQL query.

We're obviously not going to put this all in the system prompt, instead we store this information in a vector database and let the Agent query it at runtime.

Using this information, the Agent can then generate the best-possible SQL query. This is called dynamic few-shot learning.
</Accordion>

**Agno Agents use Agentic RAG** by default, meaning if you add `knowledge` to an Agent, it will search this knowledge base, at runtime, for the specific information it needs to achieve its task.

The pseudo steps for adding knowledge to an Agent are:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent, AgentKnowledge

# Create a knowledge base for the Agent
knowledge_base = AgentKnowledge(vector_db=...)

# Add information to the knowledge base
knowledge_base.load_text("The sky is blue")

# Add the knowledge base to the Agent and
# give it a tool to search the knowledge base as needed
agent = Agent(knowledge=knowledge_base, search_knowledge=True)
```

We can give our agent access to the knowledge base in the following ways:

- We can set `search_knowledge=True` to add a `search_knowledge_base()` tool to the Agent. `search_knowledge` is `True` **by default** if you add `knowledge` to an Agent.
- We can set `add_references=True` to automatically add references from the knowledge base to the Agent's prompt. This is the traditional 2023 RAG approach.

<Tip>

If you need complete control over the knowledge base search, you can pass your own `retriever` function with the following signature:

```python
def retriever(agent: Agent, query: str, num_documents: Optional[int], **kwargs) -> Optional[list[dict]]:
  ...
```

This function is called during `search_knowledge_base()` and is used by the Agent to retrieve references from the knowledge base.
For more details check out the [Custom Retriever](../knowledge/custom_retriever) page.

## Vector Databases

While any type of storage can act as a knowledge base, vector databases offer the best solution for retrieving relevant results from dense information quickly. Here's how vector databases are used with Agents:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Chunk the information">
    Break down the knowledge into smaller chunks to ensure our search query
    returns only relevant results.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Load the knowledge base">
    Convert the chunks into embedding vectors and store them in a vector
    database.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Search the knowledge base">
    When the user sends a message, we convert the input message into an
    embedding and "search" for nearest neighbors in the vector database.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Loading the Knowledge Base

Before you can use a knowledge base, it needs to be loaded with embeddings that will be used for retrieval. 

### Asynchronous Loading

Many vector databases support asynchronous operations, which can significantly improve performance when loading large knowledge bases. You can leverage this capability using the `aload()` method:

```python
import asyncio

from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.knowledge.pdf import PDFKnowledgeBase, PDFReader
from agno.vectordb.qdrant import Qdrant

COLLECTION_NAME = "pdf-reader"

vector_db = Qdrant(collection=COLLECTION_NAME, url="http://localhost:6333")

# Create a knowledge base with the PDFs from the data/pdfs directory
knowledge_base = PDFKnowledgeBase(
    path="data/pdf",
    vector_db=vector_db,
    reader=PDFReader(chunk=True),
)

# Create an agent with the knowledge base
agent = Agent(
    knowledge=knowledge_base,
    search_knowledge=True,
)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Comment out after first run
    asyncio.run(knowledge_base.aload(recreate=False))

    # Create and use the agent
    asyncio.run(agent.aprint_response("How to make Thai curry?", markdown=True))
```

Using `aload()` ensures you take full advantage of the non-blocking operations, concurrent processing, and reduced latency that async vector database operations offer. This is especially valuable in production environments with high throughput requirements.
