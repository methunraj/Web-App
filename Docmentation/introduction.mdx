**It helps you progressively build the 5 levels of Agentic Systems:**
- **Level 1: Agents with tools and instructions.**
- **Level 2: Agents with knowledge and storage.**
- **Level 3: Agents with memory and reasoning.**
- **Level 4: Teams of Agents with collaboration and coordination.**
- **Level 5: Agentic Workflows with state and determinism.**

Here's a Investment Research Agent that analyzes stocks, reasoning through each step:

```python reasoning_finance_agent.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude
from agno.tools.reasoning import ReasoningTools
from agno.tools.yfinance import YFinanceTools

agent = Agent(
    model=Claude(id="claude-3-7-sonnet-latest"),
    tools=[
        ReasoningTools(add_instructions=True),
        YFinanceTools(stock_price=True, analyst_recommendations=True, company_info=True, company_news=True),
    ],
    instructions=[
        "Use tables to display data",
        "Only output the report, no other text",
    ],
    markdown=True,
)
agent.print_response("Write a report on NVDA", stream=True, show_full_reasoning=True, stream_intermediate_steps=True)
```

# Key features

Agno is simple, fast and model-agnostic. Here are some key features:

- **Model Agnostic**: Agno Agents can connect to 23+ model providers, no lock-in.
- **Lightning Fast**: Agents instantiate in **~3Î¼s** and use **~5Kib** memory on average (see [performance](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno#performance) for more details).
- **Reasoning is a first class citizen**: Make your Agents "think" and "analyze" using Reasoning Models, `ReasoningTools` or our custom `chain-of-thought` approach.
- **Natively Multi-Modal**: Agno Agents are natively multi-modal, they can take in text, image, audio and video and generate text, image, audio and video as output.
- **Advanced Multi-Agent Architecture**: Agno provides an industry leading multi-agent architecture (**Agent Teams**) with 3 different modes: `route`, `collaborate` and `coordinate`.
- **Agentic Search built-in**: Give your Agents the ability to search for information at runtime using one of 20+ vector databases. Get access to state-of-the-art Agentic RAG that uses hybrid search with re-ranking. **Fully async and highly performant.**
- **Long-term Memory & Session Storage**: Agno provides plug-n-play `Storage` & `Memory` drivers that give your Agents long-term memory and session storage.
- **Structured Outputs**: Agno Agents can return fully-typed responses using model provided structured outputs or `json_mode`.
- **Pre-built FastAPI Routes**: Agno provides pre-built FastAPI routes to serve your Agents, Teams and Workflows.
- **Monitoring**: Monitor agent sessions and performance in real-time on [agno.com](https://app.agno.com).

# Getting Started

If you're new to Agno, start by building your [first Agent](/introduction/agents), chat with it on the [playground](/introduction/playground) and finally, monitor it on [app.agno.com](https://app.agno.com) using this [guide](/introduction/monitoring).
