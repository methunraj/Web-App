title: X (Twitter)
---

## Prerequisites

The following example requires the `tweepy` library.

```shell
pip install tweepy
```

To set up an X developer account and obtain the necessary keys, follow these steps:

1. **Create an X Developer Account:**
   - Go to the X Developer website: https://developer.x.com/
   - Sign in with your X account or create a new one if you don't have an account.
   - Apply for a developer account by providing the required information about your intended use of the X API.

2. **Create a Project and App:**
   - Once your developer account is approved, log in to the X Developer portal.
   - Navigate to the "Projects & Apps" section and create a new project.
   - Within the project, create a new app. This app will be used to generate the necessary API keys and tokens.
   - You'll get a client id and client secret, but you can ignore them.

3. **Generate API Keys, Tokens, and Client Credentials:**
   - After creating the app, navigate to the "Keys and tokens" tab.
   - Generate the following keys, tokens, and client credentials:
     - **API Key (Consumer Key)**
     - **API Secret Key (Consumer Secret)**
     - **Bearer Token**
     - **Access Token**
     - **Access Token Secret**

4. **Set Environment Variables:**
   - Export the generated keys, tokens, and client credentials as environment variables in your system or provide them as arguments to the `XTools` constructor.
     - `X_CONSUMER_KEY`
     - `X_CONSUMER_SECRET`
     - `X_ACCESS_TOKEN`
     - `X_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`
     - `X_BEARER_TOKEN`


## Example

The following example demonstrates how to use the X toolkit to interact with X (formerly Twitter) API:

```python cookbook/tools/x_tools.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.tools.x import XTools

# Initialize the X toolkit
x_tools = XTools()

# Create an agent with the X toolkit
agent = Agent(
    instructions=[
        "Use your tools to interact with X as the authorized user",
        "When asked to create a tweet, generate appropriate content based on the request",
        "Do not post tweets unless explicitly instructed to do so",
        "Provide informative responses about the user's timeline and tweets",
        "Respect X's usage policies and rate limits",
    ],
    tools=[x_tools],
    show_tool_calls=True,
)

# Example: Get user profile
agent.print_response("Get my X profile", markdown=True)

# Example: Get user timeline
agent.print_response("Get my timeline", markdown=True)

# Example: Create and post a tweet
agent.print_response("Create a post about AI ethics", markdown=True)

# Example: Get information about a user
agent.print_response("Can you retrieve information about this user https://x.com/AgnoAgi ", markdown=True)

# Example: Reply to a post
agent.print_response(
    "Can you reply to this [post ID] post as a general message as to how great this project is: https://x.com/AgnoAgi",
    markdown=True,
)

# Example: Send a direct message
agent.print_response(
    "Send direct message to the user @AgnoAgi telling them I want to learn more about them and a link to their community.",
    markdown=True,
)
```
