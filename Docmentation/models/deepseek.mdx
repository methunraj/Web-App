description: Learn how to use DeepSeek models in Agno.

DeepSeek is a platform for providing endpoints for Large Language models.
See their library of models [here](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/pricing).

We recommend experimenting to find the best-suited model for your use-case. Here are some general recommendations:

- `deepseek-chat` model is good for most basic use-cases.
- `deepseek-reasoner` model is good for complex reasoning and multi-step tasks.

DeepSeek does not have rate limits. See their [docs](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/rate_limit) for information about how to deal with slower responses during high traffic.

## Authentication

Set your `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` environment variable. Get your key from [here](https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys).

<CodeGroup>

```bash Mac
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=***
```

```bash Windows
setx DEEPSEEK_API_KEY ***
```

</CodeGroup>

## Example

Use `DeepSeek` with your `Agent`:

<CodeGroup>

```python agent.py
from agno.agent import Agent, RunResponse
from agno.models.deepseek import DeepSeek

agent = Agent(model=DeepSeek(), markdown=True)

# Print the response in the terminal
agent.print_response("Share a 2 sentence horror story.")

```

</CodeGroup>
