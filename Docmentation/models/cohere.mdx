Leverage Cohere's powerful command models and more.

[Cohere](https://cohere.com) has a wide range of models and is really good for fine-tuning. See their library of models [here](https://docs.cohere.com/v2/docs/models).

We recommend experimenting to find the best-suited model for your use-case. Here are some general recommendations:

- `command` model is good for most basic use-cases.
- `command-light` model is good for smaller tasks and faster inference.
- `command-r7b-12-2024` model is good with RAG tasks, complex reasoning and multi-step tasks.

Cohere also supports fine-tuning models. Here is a [guide](https://docs.cohere.com/v2/docs/fine-tuning) on how to do it.

Cohere has tier-based rate limits. See the [docs](https://docs.cohere.com/v2/docs/rate-limits) for more information.

## Authentication

Set your `CO_API_KEY` environment variable. Get your key from [here](https://dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys).

<CodeGroup>

```bash Mac
export CO_API_KEY=***
```

```bash Windows
setx CO_API_KEY ***
```

</CodeGroup>

## Example

Use `Cohere` with your `Agent`:

<CodeGroup>

```python agent.py
from agno.agent import Agent, RunResponse
from agno.models.cohere import Cohere

agent = Agent(
    model=Cohere(id="command-r-08-2024"),
    markdown=True
)

# Print the response in the terminal
agent.print_response("Share a 2 sentence horror story.")

```

</CodeGroup>

## Params

<Snippet file="model-cohere-params.mdx" />

`Cohere` is a subclass of the [Model](/reference/models/model) class and has access to the same params.
