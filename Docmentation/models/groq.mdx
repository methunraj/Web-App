Groq offers blazing-fast API endpoints for large language models.

See all the Groq supported models [here](https://console.groq.com/docs/models).

- We recommend using `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` for general use
- We recommend `llama-3.1-8b-instant` for a faster result.
- We recommend using `llama-3.2-90b-vision-preview` for image understanding.

#### Multimodal Support

With Groq we support `Image` as input

## Authentication

Set your `GROQ_API_KEY` environment variable. Get your key from [here](https://console.groq.com/keys).

<CodeGroup>

```bash Mac
export GROQ_API_KEY=***
```

```bash Windows
setx GROQ_API_KEY ***
```

</CodeGroup>

## Example

Use `Groq` with your `Agent`:

<CodeGroup>

```python agent.py
from agno.agent import Agent, RunResponse
from agno.models.groq import Groq

agent = Agent(
    model=Groq(id="llama-3.3-70b-versatile"),
    markdown=True
)

# Print the response in the terminal
agent.print_response("Share a 2 sentence horror story.")

```

</CodeGroup>

## Params

<Snippet file="model-groq-params.mdx" />

`Groq` is a subclass of the [Model](/reference/models/model) class and has access to the same params.
