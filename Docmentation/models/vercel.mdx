description: Learn how to use Vercel v0 models with Agno.
---

The Vercel v0 API provides large language models, designed for building modern web applications. It supports text and image inputs, provides fast streaming responses, and is compatible with the OpenAI Chat Completions API format. It is optimized for frontend and full-stack web development code generation.

For more details, refer to the [official Vercel v0 API documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/v0/api).

## Authentication

Set your `V0_API_KEY` environment variable. You can create an API key on [v0.dev](https://v0.dev/chat/settings/keys).

<CodeGroup>

```bash Mac
export V0_API_KEY=your-v0-api-key
```

```bash Windows
setx V0_API_KEY your-v0-api-key
```

</CodeGroup>

## Example

Use `v0` with your `Agent`. The following example assumes you have the `v0` Python class (as you provided) located at `agno/models/vercel.py`.

<CodeGroup>

```python agent.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.vercel import v0

agent = Agent(
    model=v0(id="v0-1.0-md"),
    markdown=True
)

# Print the response in the terminal
agent.print_response("Create a simple web app that displays a random number between 1 and 100.")

# agent.print_response("Create a webapp to fetch the weather of a city and display humidity, temperature, and wind speed in cards, use shadcn components and tailwind css")

```
