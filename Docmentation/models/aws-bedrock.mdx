description: Learn how to use AWS Bedrock with Agno.
---

Use AWS Bedrock to access various foundation models on AWS. Manage your access to models [on the portal](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home?region=us-east-1#/model-catalog).

See all the [AWS Bedrock foundational models](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/models-supported.html). Not all Bedrock models support all features. See the [supported features for each model](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/conversation-inference-supported-models-features.html).

We recommend experimenting to find the best-suited model for your use-case. Here are some general recommendations:

- For a Mistral model with generally good performance, look at `mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0`.
- You can play with Amazon Nova models. Use `amazon.nova-pro-v1:0` for general purpose tasks.
- For Claude models, see our [Claude integration](/models/aws-claude).

<Warning>
Async usage of AWS Bedrock is not yet supported. When using `AwsBedrock` with an `Agent`, you can only use `agent.run` and `agent.print_response`. 
</Warning>

## Authentication

Set your `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_REGION` environment variables.

Get your keys from [here](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-1#/home).

<CodeGroup>

```bash Mac
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=***
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=***
export AWS_REGION=***
```

```bash Windows
setx AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID ***
setx AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY ***
setx AWS_REGION ***
```

</CodeGroup>

## Example

Use `AwsBedrock` with your `Agent`:

<CodeGroup>

```python agent.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.aws import AwsBedrock

agent = Agent(
    model=AwsBedrock(id="mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0"),
    markdown=True
)

# Print the response on the terminal
agent.print_response("Share a 2 sentence horror story.")
```

</CodeGroup>

## Parameters

<Snippet file="model-aws-params.mdx" />

`AwsBedrock` is a subclass of the [Model](/reference/models/model) class and has access to the same params.
