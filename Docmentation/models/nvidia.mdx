NVIDIA offers a suite of high-performance language models optimized for advanced NLP tasks.
These models are part of the NeMo framework, which provides tools for training, fine-tuning
and deploying state-of-the-art models efficiently. NVIDIA’s language models are designed to
handle large-scale workloads with GPU acceleration for faster inference and training.
We recommend experimenting with NVIDIA’s models to find the best fit for your application.

## Authentication

Set your `NVIDIA_API_KEY` environment variable. Get your key [from Nvidia here](https://build.nvidia.com/explore/discover).

<CodeGroup>

```bash Mac
export NVIDIA_API_KEY=***
```

```bash Windows
setx NVIDIA_API_KEY ***
```

</CodeGroup>

## Example

Use `Nvidia` with your `Agent`:

<CodeGroup>

```python agent.py
from agno.agent import Agent, RunResponse
from agno.models.nvidia import Nvidia

agent = Agent(model=Nvidia(), markdown=True)

# Print the response in the terminal
agent.print_response("Share a 2 sentence horror story")

```

</CodeGroup>
