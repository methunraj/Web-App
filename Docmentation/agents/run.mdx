title: Agent.run()
---

The `Agent.run()` function runs the agent and generates a response, either as a `RunResponse` object or a stream of `RunResponse` objects.

Many of our examples use `agent.print_response()` which is a helper utility to print the response in the terminal. It uses `agent.run()` under the hood.

Here's how to run your agent. The response is captured in the `response` and `response_stream` variables.

```python
from typing import Iterator
from agno.agent import Agent, RunResponse
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.utils.pprint import pprint_run_response

agent = Agent(model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o-mini"))

# Run agent and return the response as a variable
response: RunResponse = agent.run("Tell me a 5 second short story about a robot")
# Run agent and return the response as a stream
response_stream: Iterator[RunResponse] = agent.run("Tell me a 5 second short story about a lion", stream=True)

# Print the response in markdown format
pprint_run_response(response, markdown=True)
# Print the response stream in markdown format
pprint_run_response(response_stream, markdown=True)
```

<Note>Set `stream=True` to return a stream of `RunResponse` objects.</Note>

## RunResponse

The `Agent.run()` function returns either a `RunResponse` object or an `Iterator[RunResponse]` when `stream=True`. It has the following attributes:

## Streaming Intermediate Steps

Throughout the execution of an agent, multiple events take place, and we provide these events in real-time for enhanced agent transparency.

You can enable streaming of intermediate steps by setting `stream_intermediate_steps=True`.

```python
# Stream with intermediate steps
response_stream = agent.run(
    "Tell me a 5 second short story about a lion",
    stream=True,
    stream_intermediate_steps=True
)
```

### Event Types

The following events are sent by the `Agent.run()` and `Agent.arun()` functions depending on agent's configuration:

| Event Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `RunStarted` | Indicates the start of a run |
| `RunResponse` | Contains the model's response text as individual chunks |
| `RunCompleted` | Signals successful completion of the run |
| `RunError` | Indicates an error occurred during the run |
| `RunCancelled` | Signals that the run was cancelled |
| `ToolCallStarted` | Indicates the start of a tool call |
| `ToolCallCompleted` | Signals completion of a tool call. This also contains the tool call results. |
| `ReasoningStarted` | Indicates the start of the agent's reasoning process |
| `ReasoningStep` | Contains a single step in the reasoning process |
| `ReasoningCompleted` | Signals completion of the reasoning process |
| `UpdatingMemory` | Indicates that the agent is updating its memory |
| `WorkflowStarted` | Indicates the start of a workflow |
| `WorkflowCompleted` | Signals completion of a workflow |

You can see this behavior in action in our [Playground](https://app.agno.com/playground/agents?endpoint=demo.agnoagents.com&agent=reasoning-agent).
