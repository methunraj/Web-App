## Building your AI Product

The `agent-app` comes with common endpoints that you can use to build your AI product. This API is developed in close collaboration with real AI Apps and are a great starting point.

The general workflow is:

- Your front-end/product will call the `POST /v1/agents/{agent_id}/runs` to run Agents.
- Using the `session_id` returned, your product can continue and serve chats to its users.
