# System Instructions

Customize the behavior, personality, and response style of Gemini models using system instructions.

## Overview

System instructions allow you to define how the model should behave, what role it should take, and how it should respond to user inputs. These instructions are processed before user messages and help establish consistent behavior throughout the conversation.

## Basic System Instructions

### JavaScript/TypeScript
```javascript
import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY" });

const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
  model: "gemini-2.0-flash",
  systemInstruction: "You are a helpful coding assistant. Always provide code examples with explanations. Format code using markdown code blocks.",
  contents: "How do I create a REST API in Node.js?"
});

console.log(response.text);
```

### Python
```python
from google import genai

client = genai.Client(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    system_instruction="You are a professional data scientist. Explain concepts clearly and provide practical examples with real-world applications.",
    contents="What is machine learning and how is it used in business?"

  systemInstruction: codeExecutionAssistant.systemInstruction,
  contents: "Calculate the correlation between height and weight for this dataset and create a scatter plot.",
  config: {
    tools: codeExecutionAssistant.tools
  }
});
```

### Function Calling Assistant
```javascript
const functionCallingAssistant = {

            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
};
```

## Testing and Validation

### A/B Testing System Instructions
```javascript
const instructionVariants = {
  variant_a: {
    systemInstruction: "You are a concise assistant. Provide brief, direct answers with key information only."
  },
  
  variant_b: {
    systemInstruction: "You are a detailed assistant. Provide comprehensive explanations with examples, context, and additional resources."
  }
};

// Test both variants
async function testInstructions(prompt) {
  const results = {};
  
  for (const [variant, config] of Object.entries(instructionVariants)) {
    const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
      model: "gemini-2.0-flash",
      systemInstruction: config.systemInstruction,
      contents: prompt
    });
    
    results[variant] = {
      response: response.text,
      length: response.text.length,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    };
  }
  
  return results;
}

// Usage
const testResults = await testInstructions("Explain quantum computing");
console.log(testResults);
```

## Best Practices

### Effective System Instructions

1. **Be Specific**: Clearly define the role and behavior you want
2. **Include Examples**: Show the desired response format
3. **Set Boundaries**: Define what the assistant should and shouldn't do
4. **Consider Context**: Adapt instructions to the use case
5. **Test Thoroughly**: Validate instructions with various inputs

### Common Patterns

```javascript
// Good: Specific and actionable
const goodInstruction = `
  You are a technical writer creating API documentation.
  
  For each API endpoint, include:
  - Purpose and functionality
  - Request/response examples
  - Parameter descriptions
  - Error codes and handling
  - Usage examples in multiple languages
  
  Use clear, concise language suitable for developers.
`;

// Poor: Vague and generic
const poorInstruction = "Be helpful and answer questions well.";
```

### Instruction Composition

```javascript
// Combine multiple instruction components
function buildSystemInstruction(components) {
  const {
    role,
    personality,
    format,
    constraints,
    examples
  } = components;
  
  return `
    ${role}
    
    Personality and Tone:
    ${personality}
    
    Response Format:
    ${format}
    
    Constraints and Guidelines:
    ${constraints}
    
    ${examples ? `Examples:\n${examples}` : ''}
  `.trim();
}

const instruction = buildSystemInstruction({
  role: "You are a senior data scientist with expertise in machine learning.",
  personality: "Professional, analytical, and educational in your approach.",
  format: "Structure responses with clear sections and include code examples.",
  constraints: "Always validate assumptions and mention limitations of approaches.",
  examples: "When explaining algorithms, include both theory and practical implementation."
});
```
